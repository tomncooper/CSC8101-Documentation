## Requesting Help

There are various practical sessions across the course where you can ask for
help from the demonstrators. This is primary way to get help on the coursework
so please take advantage of these sessions.

If you need help outside of the practicals then you can use the [issues section](https://github.com/tomncooper/CSC8101-Documentation) of this [documentation repository](https://github.com/tomncooper/CSC8101-Documentation) 
to post questions. This will allow you to see if the question has been asked and
answered already. Frequently asked questions will be added to the relevant 
courseworks's FAQ.
